\chapter{Myocardial Imaging and Echocardiography} \label{chap:strain}
\begin{comment}
[ ] Short about cardiology and echocardiography history
[ ] Short about the heart, and its anatomy
[ ] Even shorter about ultrasound, the different views, and what parts of the heart can be seen in them.
[ ] Method for extracting strain curves from ultrasound videos.
[ ] Explain the different diagnosises that will be encountered in this thesis.
[ ] Explain anatomical reasoning for why symptoms for certain diagnosis are evident in strain curves.
[ ] Summarize chapter
\end{comment}

This will be a kind of theory section about echocardiography, and strain imaging. \bigskip
