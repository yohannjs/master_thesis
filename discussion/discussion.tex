This is the discussion. \bigskip

\section{Time-series Clustering}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss why methods using data from single view performed better.
    \item Discuss why methods using data using ''regular'' or ''scaled'' performed better than methods using normalization or z-normalization.
\end{itemize}

\section{Peak-value Clustering}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comment on the fact that TSC generally performs better than PVC.
    \item Note that the PVC methods that use combination of peak systolic strain values and EF performs significantly better, future work could be to combine EF values with strain curves as well.
