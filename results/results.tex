\chapter{Results}

In this chapter the results will be presented in the form of three case studies. 
Each case study will focus on a single target variable, and aims to find which model group performs best at predicting the target variable in question.
Recall that the three target variables that will be considered in this thesis are: Heart failure, patient diagnosis, and the indication of individual left ventricle segments.
As mentioned earlier in the chapter, four model groups will be tested. 
The case studies will first deal with each model group individually, where variants of the models with different hypermarameters will be tested on the different datasets. 
Then, the best performing model within each model group will be used to compare the four model groups.
The supervised models will be assessed with the metrics: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and DOR.
The unsupervised models evaluated at two cluster centers will be assessed with the same methods as the supervised models, and with ARI to determine 
whether the models evaluated at a higher number of cluster centers could fit the data better.
