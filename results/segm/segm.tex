\end{table*}

From the distribution plot in figure \ref{fig:tsc_segm_ind_dor_sens_spec_dist}a one can see that the majority of the \acrshort{dor} are close to zero, but a few models are able to achieve \acrshort{dor} above 12, and some models attain a \acrshort{dor} close to 15 when applied to identify segment indication. From the scatter plot in figure \ref{fig:tsc_segm_ind_dor_sens_spec_dist}b one can see that the sensitivity of the \acrshort{tsc} models range from $0.25$ to 1, and the specificity of the \acrshort{tsc} models range from 0 to approximately 1. The spread in both sensitivity and specificity is quite large, and there are very few models that are able to a attain a high sensitivity while at the same time attaining a high specificity, and vice versa. Common to the high performing \acrshort{tsc} models in terms of \acrshort{dor} is that they all use either no preprocessing at all, or scaling. \textit{z-norm/complete/2} is the seventh best \acrshort{tsc} model in terms of \acrshort{dor}, and attains a \acrshort{dor} of 5.92 when applied to identify segment indication. \textit{norm/ward/2} is the ninth best models in terms of \acrshort{dor}, and attains a \acrshort{dor} of 1.56, when applied to identify segment indication. This can be comfirmed from table \ref{tab:tsc_segm_ind_raw_results}. The two \acrshort{tsc} models attaining the highest \acrshort{dor} \textit{regular/weighted/2}, and \textit{scaled/weighted/2} differ only in type of preprocessing used. From table \ref{tab:tsc_segm_ind_dor_sens_spec_dist} and table \ref{tab:tsc_segm_ind_raw_results} one can see that the two models attain the same scores in all metrics, this is because they yield the exact same cluster assignments to the individual segment strain curves. The same goes for the next two \acrshort{tsc} models in line \textit{regular/ward/2} \textit{scaled/ward/2}, these two models are also the models that attain the highest accarcy of all the \acrshort{tsc} models. Of the two \acrshort{tsc} models \textit{regular/weighted/2}, and \textit{regular/ward/2} the latter is preferred for predicting segment indication because \textit{regular/ward/2} has a more persistent performance in both sensitivity and specificity, where as \textit{regular/weighted/2} has a high specificity, but a very low sensitivity.

    \label{tab:tsc_segm_ind_ari}
\end{table*}

The majority of the \acrshort{ari} of \acrshort{tsc} models applied to identify segment indication, but as one can see from table \ref{tab:tsc_segm_ind_ari} some models are able to attain \acrshort{ari} above 25. As with the other case studies, the \acrshort{tsc} models that attain the highest \acrshort{ari} are models that use either no preprocessing at all or scaling. Puzzlingly enough the top two \acrshort{tsc} models for classifying segment indication in terms of \acrshort{ari}, are models evaluated at five cluster centers, not two. TSC models \textit{scaled/centroid/5}, and \textit{regular/centroid/5} differ only in type of preprocessing used, and they yield the exact same cluster assignments, and evaluations scores. The next two models in order of \acrshort{ari} \textit{regular/ward/2}, and \textit{scaled/ward/2} are familiar from the list of \acrshort{tsc} models attaining the highest \acrshort{dor} when applied to identify segment indication. From table \ref{tab:tsc_segm_ind_ari} one can also see that the difference in \acrshort{ari} between \textit{regular/centroid/5}, and \textit{regular/ward/2} is only 0.002 Since the \textit{regular/ward/2} model will be considered the best of the \acrshort{tsc} models at classifying segment indication. It attains the third highest \acrshort{ari} of all the \acrshort{tsc} models applied to identify segment indication, and is the preferred model among the \acrshort{tsc} models evaluated at two cluster centers.

        regular     &      0.74 &         0.80 &         0.68 & 8.65 \\
        downsampled &      0.74 &         0.74 &         0.75 & 8.38 \\
        upsampled   &      0.65 &         0.55 &         0.73 & 3.36 \\

    \caption{Evaluation metrics of the \acrshort{ann} for classifying the binary indication of individual segments in the left ventricle.}
    \label{tab:ANN_segm_ind_perf}
\end{table*}

Of the three variations of the \acrshort{ann} model, the one that uses no resampling, and the one that downsamples all signals to the lowest sample rate achieve relatively similar \acrshort{dor} scores. The variation that upsamples the sample rate of all the curves to the highest sample rate performs significantly worse than the other two in terms of \acrshort{dor} and sensitivity. Of the three variations the model that uses downsampling is the preferred model of the three since its sensitivity and specificity are more balanced than the model that uses no resampling, and accuracy is higher than the model that uses upsampling.

    \caption{A table comparing the best contenders within each model group for predicting segment indication. 
             The top table compare the models by their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and \acrshort{dor}, 
             and the bottom table shows the number of TPs, TNs, FPs and FNs that the different models attain.}
    \label{tab:segm_ind_compare}
\end{table*}

From table \ref{tab:segm_ind_compare} one can see that the performances of the \acrshort{ann}, and \acrshort{tsc} models are quite close in terms of accuracy, but differ significantly in the other metrics. The \acrshort{tsc} model \textit{regular/ward/2} attains a higher accuracy, specificity and \acrshort{dor} than the \acrshort{ann} model \textit{downsampled}. This can also be confirmed by the fact that the \acrshort{tsc} model attains more TN, and fewer FP than the \acrshort{ann} model.  The \acrshort{ann} model attains the highest sensitivity, which can be confirmed by the fact that it attains more TP and fewer FN than the \acrshort{tsc} model. The \acrshort{ann} model is also the model that attains the most balanced scores of sensitivity and specificity. Therefore the \acrshort{ann} model is chosen as the best performer at predicting the segment indication.
