    \textbf{Objectives}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Can an ML model be used to identify the following three binary target variables, using longitudinal strain from the left ventricle of the heart? Does the patient have heart failure, does the patient have a heart disease, are the individual segments of the patients left ventrice acting abnormally.
        \item Which type of machine learning is best suited for predicting the aforementioned target variables, supervised, or unsupervised learning models?
        \item Which type of dataset works best for a ML model to predict the target variables, a dataset consisting of longitudinal strain curves, or a dataset that consists of peak systolic longitudinal strain values in combination with EF?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Structure of Thesis}

Here the outline for the rest of the assignment will be given.
