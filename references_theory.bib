    abstract    = {Mixture of autoregressions (MoAR) models provide a model-based approach to the clustering of time series data. The maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of MoAR models requires evaluating products of large numbers of densities of normal random variables. In practical scenarios, these products converge to zero as the length of the time series increases, and thus the ML estimation of MoAR models becomes infeasible without the use of numerical tricks. We propose a maximum pseudolikelihood (MPL) estimation approach as an alternative to the use of numerical tricks. The MPL estimator is proved to be consistent and can be computed with an EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm. Simulations are used to assess the performance of the MPL estimator against that of the ML estimator in cases where the latter was able to be calculated. An application to the clustering of time series data arising from a resting state fMRI experiment is presented as a demonstration of the methodology.},

    abstract    = {In this paper, we propose a novel approach for clustering time series, which combines three well-known aspects: a permutation-based coding of the time series, several distance measurements for discrete distributions and hierarchical clustering using different linkages. The proposed method classifies a set of time series into homogeneous groups, according to the degree of dependency among them. That is, time series with a high level of dependency will lie in the same cluster. Moreover, taking into account the nature of the codifying process, the method allows us to detect linear and nonlinear dependences. To illustrate the procedure, a set of fourteen electricity price series coming from different wholesale electricity markets worldwide was analyzed. We show that the classification results are consistent with the characteristics of the electricity markets in the study and with their degree of integration. Besides, we outline the necessity of removing the seasonal component of the price series before the analysis and the capability of the method to detect changes in the dependence level along time.},

    abstract    = {This study introduces a new distance measure for clustering financial time series based on variance ratio test statistics. The proposed metric attempts to assess the level of interdependence of time series from the point of view of return predictability. Simulation results show that this metric aggregates time series according to their serial dependence structure better than a metric based on the sample autocorrelations. An empirical application of this approach to international stock market returns is presented. The results suggest that this metric discriminates stock markets reasonably well according to size and the level of development. Furthermore, despite the substantial evolution of individual variance ratio statistics, the clustering pattern remains fairly stable across different time periods.},

    abstract    = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is a method to recover the original independent variables from the linear transformations of the observations. Most of ICA algorithms are formulated as an optimization of a contrast function which minimizes the cross-dependency among the components. In this paper, we propose an innovative algorithm for performing ICA problem which uses a contrast function based on the Hoeffding’s measure of pairwise dependence. This measure takes its minimum if and only if the random variables are independent, and takes its maximum if and only if one of the variable is a function of the other. Since the Hoeffding’s index is computed based on the rank values rather than the actual values of the data, it is significantly robust to the outliers and performs well even in the presence of noise. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using simulated data. The algorithm is utilized as a pre-processing method for clustering of trends in time series data. This pre-processing technique establish new components from original observations which have adequate information trend of time series. For illustrative purposes, the proposed methodology is applied to clustering of two real data sets involving financial time series.},
